# This is where it all happens...
# This file is executable Perl code, and its sole purpose is to define the
# %Lifecycle::Lite hash (a Perl hash is like a Python dictionary). This
# hash must contain certain structures that drive the Lifecycle agent, and
# also contains the data needed to drive the workflows.
#
# If you make changes to this file, you should check that the syntax is
# correct by running 'perl -c <this-file-name>' and checking that there
# are no errors.

# We define sections for Globals, Templates, Defaults, and Workflows.
# Each Workflow represents an instance of a task-chain, with all the
# parameters it needs to drive it. For convenience, a Workflow can pick up
# defaults from a Template. If any parameter values are left unresolved,
# they are picked up from the Defaults, or if not defined there, from the
# Globals.
# This is not strictly an object-oriented hierarchy, but it sure cuts down
# on the typing needed to instantiate and modify a complex system.

# These are true globals. Overriding these per Workflow does not make sense
